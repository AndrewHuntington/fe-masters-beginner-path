## CSS Foundations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This ended up being a code-along course, so I do not claim any ownership of the code in this folder.

### Some concepts that I either learned, were reintroduced to, or just found interesting from this course:

- The `@import` feature for CSS
- [Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors#combinators_and_separators)
  - Child combinator (>) vs. Descendant combinator (" ")
  - Next-sibling (adjacent) combinator (+)
  - Subsequent sibling combinator (~)
- [margin-inline-end](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-inline-end)
- websites that help with CSS grid generation
- position: fixed vs. sticky
- [vertical-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) (specifically when used to vertically center content with the `middle` value)
- [outline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline) -- Newly available. Works across all devices/browsers as of March 2023
- How to use the fill and stroke CSS properties on inline SVGs
  - For stroke, you can target the `<svg>` element, but for fill, you must target the child `<path>` element
- How to use `object-fit` & `object-position` properties along with height and width to deal with images that are of differing sizes
