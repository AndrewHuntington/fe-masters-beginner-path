## CSS Foundations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This ended up being a code-along course, so I do not claim any ownership of the code in this folder.

### Some concepts that I either learned, were reintroduced to, or just found interesting from this course:

- The `@import` feature for CSS
- [Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors#combinators_and_separators)
  - Child combinator (>) vs. Descendant combinator (" ")
  - Next-sibling (adjacent) combinator (+)
  - Subsequent sibling combinator (~)
- [margin-inline-end](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-inline-end)
